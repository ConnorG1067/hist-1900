This is to give the reader an understanding that all ideas have connections and it's up to us, the writer and reader, to determine what these connections are. The next note in our journey is about the cold war between the United States and Russia. This \"war\" demonstrates the mediums of communication. Propaganda was the main medium being fed to both countries on both sides. However, the technological advancements made during this time also played a role in how people communicated. Not too long after the cold war, the Berlin Wall fell, this was symbolic. It demonstrated the free flow of information between individuals regardless of their origin. With the expansion of information and ways to communicate said information comes, those who have malicious intent. misinformation and disinformation are at an all-time high due to the expansion of mediums. As more and more of the world population turns to technology the more influence individuals have. Influencers influence people. They have large followings and they intend to make money, not better society (typically).  Finally, we complete our journey with political censorship. As discussed there are a variety of mediums, however, those with power and influence can determine which mediums are accessible to a particular demographic.

If information has no bounds its extent is limitless. Now what if said information is also wrong or harmful to specific communities? We've seen this with covid-19.

It's possible that they can have the desirable body type, however, they go about it in a bad way, such as eating disorders or steroids, etc. Another prevalent example of this was covid-19. The vaccine had/has issues, however, from a probability standpoint it is safer to take the vaccine than it is to not take it.

It's possible the link is not obvious however it still does exist otherwise I wouldn't have put it in this memex. Even if I were to take the most extreme scenario where I intentionally try to violate my theorem, say I take a source at random and then you ask \"This is a random source, how could it possibly be related?\" and of course, this is a valid question. Since it is random the link could be extremely difficult to find, but still exists. This is because knowledge has a tree-like structure in which each branch is a general idea with each leaf of said branch being a specific point about the general idea. The trunk of the tree holds all our knowledge together and thus all this knowledge has connections in which the strength of the interlinkages varies depending on the distance between two leaves.

In the late nineteenth century, British firms held a near monopoly, because Britain had more advanced industry, a wealthier capital market, and a merchant marine and colonial empire that provided customers for the new service. After the 1880s, they encountered increasing competition on the North Atlantic from American, German, and French firms. Elsewhere, the British conglomerate Eastern and Associated retained its hegemony until the 1920s. Following World War I, radiotelegraphy threatened the dominance of cables. In the 1930s, cable companies were almost bankrupted by the Depression and by competition from shortwave radio.</p>"},{"location":"website/Second%20Memex/Sources/%40headrickSubmarineTelegraphCables2001/#annotations","title":"Annotations","text":"<p>%% begin annotations %%</p>"},{"location":"website/Second%20Memex/Sources/%40headrickSubmarineTelegraphCables2001/#imported-on-2023-03-07-540-pm","title":"Imported on 2023-03-07 5:40 pm","text":""},{"location":"website/Second%20Memex/Sources/%40headrickSubmarineTelegraphCables2001/#agree","title":"Agree","text":"<p>[!quote|#5fb236] Highlight International telecommunication is not only a business but also a political enterprise, the subject of great-power rival</p> <p>This small quote is meaningful and insightful.
