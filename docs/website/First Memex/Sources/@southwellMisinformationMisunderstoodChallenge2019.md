#### Key Take Aways
Southwell write a convincing article regarding misinformation as a threat to public health. However, one part really stuck with me. Southwell raises the question about algorithms detecting misinformation online and how this is potentially problematic when humans are involved. Humans are bias and thus our creations are bias.

#### Definitions / concepts

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> Misinformation is false or inaccurate information regardless of intentional authorship, and yet much discussion about misinformation has focused on malicious acts to infect social media platforms with false information.

#### Questions / confusion

> [!quote|#ffd400] Highlight
> Despite popular construction of misinformation as a uniform and acute threat, misinformation is better understood as an umbrella category of symptoms, some of which might suggest information system dysfunctions and others that are relatively less problematic from a public health perspective.

#### Agree

> [!quote|#5fb236] Highlight
> In fact, one might worry that problematic claims in advertising and elsewhere funded by commercial actors enjoy exposure that vastly outweighs what relatively limited public health media campaigns intended to counter such
>
>> This is a great point, we're worried misinformation on an individual basis, but I haven't until now, seen the potential threat of misinformation in advertising.

> [!quote|#5fb236] Highlight
> Moreover, even if exposure to a piece of misinformation grows over time, so too will prospects for fact-checking efforts to mitigate the effects of misinformation.
>
>> Agreed, As the claims become more and more outlandish, the likelihood of it being true diminishes. Therefore, skeptics help counteract misinformation online.

> [!quote|#5fb236] Highlight
> The nature of new media platforms poses challenges for thinking about the effects of and remedies against misinformation, especially because online content can be ambiguous in terms of authorship, the site of exposure, and other factors.

> [!quote|#5fb236] Highlight
> For an algorithm to identify, flag, and correct a piece of misinformation still requires a series of human-initiated tasks. Who can best identify and choose the types of misinformation to be corrected and the appropriate response?
>
>> Excellent point. Someone has to identify misinformation which is rooted in their own biases. An algorithm which detects misinformation is useful but not perfect. This algorithm obtains the biases of its creator, the human.

#### Relevant / important

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> If circulated only among a small network of people, that questionable information is likely limited both in terms of audience reach and whether consequentially unhealthy behavior is being promoted, per se.

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> At the same time, challenges also lie in the very openness of Internet-based platforms to all sorts of content producers, each of whom can spread some types of misinformation that would be protected as free speech
>
>> This is very relevant to modern

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> Some misinformation, in fact, is sowed to instill political and social mischief at a minimum and political and institutional mistrust in its worst manifestations.

#### Disagree

> [!quote|#ff6666] Highlight
> Importantly, social media platforms could develop new technologies that prevent and respond to the presence of misinformation.
>
>> These technologies already exist and are advancing everyday.
