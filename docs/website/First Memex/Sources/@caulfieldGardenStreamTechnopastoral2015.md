#### Key Take Aways
Mike Caulfield, introduces the reader to his typical way of spreading information. That is, how he communicates his point to reach an audiance. He breifly discusses the Streams and Gardens within this article. The Garden is a place where people can build on each others ideas, like the federated wiki, where as the stream is for conversation and retoric for the better or worse

> A week or so ago, I was reading about the Oregon shooting. I’m a pretty standard issue liberal and when I see things that support my liberal views I tend to notice them.

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> Without going to much into what my federated wiki journal is, just imagine that instead of blogging and tweeting your experience you wiki’d it. And over time the wiki became a representation of things you knew, connected to other people’s wikis about things they knew.

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> The Garden is what I was doing in the wiki as I added the Gun Control articles, building out a network of often conicting information into a web that can generate insights, iterating it, allowing that to grow into something bigger than a single event, a single narrative, or single meaning.

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> Let’s look at some of the attributes of the memex. Your machine is a library not a publication device. You have copies of documents is there that you control directly, that you can annotate, change, add links to, summarize, and this is because the memex is a tool to think with, not a tool to publish with.

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> This brings us to learning design. Dave Cormier had an interesting post a month or so ago about how “every we makes a them”. You get a large class together and it fragments, partially to protect itself from scale. Cliques develop. The cool kids table emerges. Others complain they are not being attended to, the cool kids say well sorry but we know each other and we want to sit next to one another.

>> This is where social media is particularly interesting. To understand what Im about to say, we must agree on the basic undeniable concept, that social media companies want to keep you on the app as long as possible. Thus, the algorithm tailors to you're liking in order to keep you engaged as long as possible to generate revenue. Now if we look at social media with a political lens this is especially dangerous. The algorithm promotes ideas that fit you're political ideologies to keep you engaged. This is especially problematic because it plunges you into a rabbit hole in which you're emotions are controlled by a computer designed to exploit you.

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> But I’ll leave you with this: we can imagine a world, I think, so much better than this one, if only we can get our heads out of the Stream for a bit, and build the Garden we need. So let’s talk about how to do that.

#### Questions / confusion

> [!quote|#ffd400] Highlight
> But for the past year I’ve been experimenting with another form of social media called federated wiki. And it’s radically changed how I think about online communication and collaboration.

> [!quote|#ffd400] Highlight
> Suicide rates in White populations are more than twice those in Black populations and the recent rise in suicide rates (so far) is a purely a White population phenomenon.

> [!quote|#ffd400] Highlight
> Everybody wants to play in the Stream, but no one wants to build the Garden.
>
> [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YF66NDCA?page=11) [[2023-02-09#11:05 am]]

#### Disagree

> [!quote|#ff6666] Highlight
> This punctures my simple story where more guns = more suicides because the truth is that western states full of White males are going to tend to have both more gun ownership and more suicide.
>
> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YF66NDCA?page=4) [[2023-02-09#9:38 am]]

> [!quote|#ff6666] Highlight
> But compared to blogging, which is so personality and conversation driven, I can’t help but feel that we’d be looking at a massive improvement in bridging social boundaries.

#### Definitions / concepts

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.
>
> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YF66NDCA?page=6) [[2023-02-09#9:42 am]]

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> the Stream is “inhospitable to strangers.”  If the Garden is exposition, the stream is conversation and rhetoric, for better and worse.
>

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> You see this most clearly in things like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. But it’s also the noti cations panel of your smartphone, it’s also email, it’s also to a large extent blogging. Frankly, it’s everything now.

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> Whereas the garden is integrative, the Stream is self-assertive. It’s persuasion, it’s argument, it’s advocacy. It’s personal and personalized and immediate. It’s invigorating. And as we may see in a minute it’s also profoundly unsuited to some of the uses we put it to.

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> Links are made by readers as well as writers. A stunning thing that we forget, but the link here is not part of the author’s intent, but of the reader’s analysis. The majority of links in the memex are made by readers, not writers. On the world wide web of course, only an author gets to determine links. And links inside the document say that there can only be one set of associations for the document, at least going forward.

#### Agree

> The bridge is a bridge is a bridge — a de ned thing with given boundaries and a stated purpose. But the multi-linear nature of the garden means that there is  Follo

> [!quote|#5fb236] Highlight
> no one right view of the bridge, no one correct approach. The architect creates the bridge, but it is the visitors to the park who create the bridge’s meaning. A good bridge supports many approaches, many views, many seasons, maybe many uses, and the meaning of that bridge will even evolve for the architect over time.

> [!quote|#5fb236] Highlight
> More than that, there’s a substance to the vision that you can’t help but long for reading it. Note that connections here aren’t banter, but the construction of a mental model of a subject area. And that model can be taken by someone else and extended, built on. Humanity can advance, not through argument by through a true collaboration.
>
>> I really like this last line. It ties the entire paragraph together. Essentially, links are important because it allows us to build off others and our own ideas rather than trying to fit one narrative.

> [!quote|#5fb236] Highlight
> You want ethics of networked knowledge? Think about that for a minute — how much time we’ve all spent arguing, promoting our ideas, and how little time we’ve spent contributing to the general pool of knowledge.
>
>> This is particularly interesting because, I am also guilty of this. When arguing you always feel as though you are right otherwise there wouldn't exist an argument. But rather than arguing we could be contributing to a pool of knowledge where specific ideas do not necessarily need to conflict but rather build upon each other. Social media is especially bad for this.

> [!quote|#5fb236] Highlight
> Why? Because we’re infatuated with the stream, infatuated with our own voice, with the argument we’re in, the point we’re trying to make, the people in our circle we’re talking to.
>
>> Another great point, we are in fact infatuated with our own voice, we rarely consider the opposition, and when we do so it's not in a genuine manner with the intent of understanding, but rather countering. This links back to the idea of how little we contribute to each others ideas.
