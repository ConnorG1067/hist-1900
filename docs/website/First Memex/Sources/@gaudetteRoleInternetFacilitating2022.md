> - **Abstract:** While a growing body of evidence suggests that the Internet is a key facil­ itator of violent extremism, research in this area has rarely incorporated former extremists’ experiences with the Internet when they were involved in violent extremism. To address this gap, in-depth interviews were con­ ducted with ten Canadian former right-wing extremists who were involved in violent racist skinhead groups, with interview questions provided by thirty Canadian law enforcement officials and ten community activists. Participants were asked about their use of the Internet and the connection between their on- and offline worlds during their involvement in the violent right-wing extremist movement. Overall, our study findings highlight the interplay between the Internet and violent extremism as well as the interactions between the on- and offline worlds of violent extremists. We conclude with a discussion of study limitations and avenues for future research.

> Study participants overwhelmingly suggested that the Internet played an important role in facilitating their process of radicalization to violence, largely because it provided them with unfettered access to extreme right-wing content and a network of like-minded individuals, which in turn increased their exposure to violent extremist ideologies and violent extremist groups.

>> As stated in [insert Mike] this is an excellent example of the "Rabbit Hole". The members of the alt-right were pulled in because of their unlimited access to right-wing content as well as the abundance of individuals with similar views.

> I definitely think it was the sense of belonging I was first looking for” (Participant 6). Worth highlighting is that approximately three-quarters of the study participants described feeling isolated and disconnected from their family and friends, which they described as making them feel vulnerable and susceptible to being recruited into violent extremist groups.

>> Again this brings us back to the Streams and Gardens. Those who feel isolated need a community. These communities exist online in which people can express themselves in anonymity.  Its one big algorithm that spreads misinformation and disinformation [link to trucker convoy]

> Following their initial exposure to violent extremist content online, study participants commonly reported that, because they wanted to feel like part of a group, they continued to use the Internet to access a variety of forms of extreme right-wing content to indulge their “newfound curiosity” in violent extremist ideologies.

#### Questions / confusion

> “I was on Stormfront [a right-wing extremist discussion forum] for a bit, but nah . . . it was almost minimal because it’s mostly just keyboard commandos and people that don’t show up for events and just like to talk a big talk and not actually follow through”
>
>> This only confirms my belief that people feel more comfortable spreading hate and extreme ideas online versus in person. The participant was willing to meet for events whereas, from his experience, a majority were only interested in communication online. To sum this note up, was this participants experience a result of a sense of anonymity online?

#### Relevant / important

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> During the discussions about exposure to violent extremist ideologies, the majority of the participants noted that, whether this exposure happened online or offline, their initial interest in the violent extremist ideologies stemmed from “wanting to be part of something,” as one participant put it
