> This anonymous twoway talk also helps depressives feel comfortable sharing ideas with others thanks to the personal control over the level of their communication, as they have time to plan, contemplate, and edit comments before sending an electronic message.

#### Questions / confusion

> [!quote|#ffd400] Highlight
> Therefore, a formal term utilized in this article is pathological Internet use (PIU) to refer to cases of addictive Internet use.
>
>> It seems hard to categorize some internet use as an addiction. Most of our lives revolves around the internet. I'm not saying this is a good thing but I do believe it is reality.

> The sample included 130 males with a mean age of 31 and 129 females with a mean age of 33.
>
>> I notice that both sexes have about the same number of addicts, but I'd be curious to see the how these addicts consume their content, or rather how they use the internet. I suspect males are more on video games whereas females are more so interesting in social media.

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> Occupational type appears to be a determinant in the level of Internet usage in this study. These results suggest that nontech or high-tech white-collar workers are more likely to become addicted to the Internet than are blue-collar workers.

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> It is plausible that depressives are drawn to electronic communication because of the anonymous cover granted to them by talking with others through fictitious handles, which helps them overcome real-life interpersonal difficulties. Kiesler et al.14 found that computer-mediated communication weakens social influence by the absence of such nonverbal behavior as talking in the head set, speaking loudly, staring, touching, and gesturing.
