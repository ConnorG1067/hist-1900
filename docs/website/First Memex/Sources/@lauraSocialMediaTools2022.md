#### Key Take Aways
This particular article from, Laura, Osman investigates the correlation between the Convoy protest and the usage of the internet.  How the Convoy utilized social media to alter reality online and generate funds. How #social-media  was used to alter the perception of those watching the situation unfold online, which lend to the manipulation of those who funded the operation. This raises question about how dangerous social media really is when the #Mediums-and-messages  are controlled by those who have an incentive to #disinform others.

#### Agree

> Social media was used to raise funds, connect organizers and spread their message. It was also used to contrast the accounts of traditional media outlets and provide a different view of what was happening on the ground, Dax D'Orazio, a political scientist and post-doctoral fellow with Queen's University, testified during an expert panel discussion before the commission Tuesday.

>> Part of this sentence seems as though the author is claiming only traditional media outlets provide valid information, which is completely false, however the reasoning behind this makes sense. Traditional media outlets have responsibility and integrity to uphold rather than some random person on their phone, and these media outlets employ professionals.

> The panellists also explored the relationship between extremist views and social media, which can provide an echo chamber that serves to confirm people's existing biases.

>> As said in other notes from other sources, once people stick to once source and one group of people, they go down a rabbit hole in which they are controlled by emotions rather than logic.

#### Questions / confusion

> Experts testified that regulating disinformation is a difficult prospect — especially since it's not illegal to spread falsehoods.

>> Who identifies misinformation<br />
Who claims something is false?<br />
When the opposition claims something is false information, is it to fit their narrative?<br />

All things to consider when identifying misinformation

#### Definitions / concepts

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> The experts defined disinformation as the intentional spread of false information, while misinformation was described as people spreading false information that they themselves believe to be true.
>
>> This also crossed my mind. Maybe this is ignorant but I genuinely believe most people want to do good, so a lot of the time I presume people are spreading misinformation rather than disinformation. And if it is disinformation there must be an incentive to lie to others. Is it power? Monetary benefits? Spreading your ideas.

> Different infrastructure is critical to different people at different times, he said, depending on the context. A small bridge that serves as the main route to transport food to a small community could be considered critical on a local scale, for instance.
>
>> This seems argumentative. I understand what is being said but when something is problematic on a federal level surely that's more important than a municipal level. Yes, different things affect different people and that scale is relative but what's important to target is the larger scale issues.  Small issues usually have more solutions, flexibility and impact than those of a larger magnitude
