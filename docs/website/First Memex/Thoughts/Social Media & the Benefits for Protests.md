For those of us in Ottawa, we all remember the Freedom Convoy of 2022.  According to a CBC news article many of the organizers utilized Social Media in order to organize events, manage to fund, and spread awareness, misinformation, and disinformation. Now obviously this Convoy was more of an occupation rather than a protest, making it illegal. However, the Convoy highlighted the ability to organize, protest, and manage funding towards the cause all through the internet. This only reinforces the idea of how powerful social media really is especially in a political context

#### Key Take Aways:
Generally, people disagreed with the Convoy protest (from experience), however, it provided clear evidence that the internet is most of the battle.  The ability to show the entire world what is happening and potentially alter that view through media is extraordinarily powerful. Not only can they alter what people see they can manipulate individuals into funding a cause that differs from the actual cause.
