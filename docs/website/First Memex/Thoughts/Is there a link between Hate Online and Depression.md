After reading both [[@youngRelationshipDepressionInternet1998]] & [[@gaudetteRoleInternetFacilitating2022]], I thought to myself, these individuals on these hate forms were lacking a community, and now that they've found their community  ( #alt-right ) . However, according to a study from [[@youngRelationshipDepressionInternet1998]] those found with depression often spend an average of 38 hours on the internet for recreational use.  If these members of the alt-right spend the majority of their day on these forms in order to feel a sense of community, surely some of them are part of this group of depressed individuals who cope with their needs online. Many forms of coping discussed in the source provided were related to #social-media usage and #video-games, two highly addictive forms of recreational internet usage. However, I've concluded that there exist outliers who cope with their depression by hating those who differ from them.
