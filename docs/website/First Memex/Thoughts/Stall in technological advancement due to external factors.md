> Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be dupliÂ­ cated by sufficient use of pencil and paper. Moreover, it would have been subject to frequent breakdown, so that it could not have been depended upon; for at that time and long after, complexity and unreliability were synonymous.

The quote above is from [[@bush132407932Pdf]]. Essentially A man named Leibnitz invented some sort of "Calculating machine", however it was never used due to a variety of factors. This sparked a thought in my mind. I don't doubt this is a rare event, in which a groundbreaking idea was brought into existence, but could never be acted upon due to external factors, such as economics, the status of the labor force, cheaper alternatives but with less potential (Paper and pencil in the case of Leibnitz). Just a thought...How much more technologically advanced would humanity be if these roadblocks were not in the way? Of course, this is unrealistic and that's why it is hypothetical but it is interesting to think that thousands of years ago the economy and labor force directly affect how we operate today.
