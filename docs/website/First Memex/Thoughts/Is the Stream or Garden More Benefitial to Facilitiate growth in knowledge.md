In [[@caulfieldGardenStreamTechnopastoral2015]] there are two ways in which humans can interact. They can interact via the Stream or the Garden. The Garden allows individuals to rearrange ideas and preexisting knowledge. The Garden is a way to build or rather grow off other ideas to expand the knowledge or ideas of interest. The stream allows us to prove and disprove and grow off ideas. This is beneficial and problematic. Some people enter the stream in hopes of learning something new and enlightening others, however, there are also those who enter the stream in hopes of always being right rather than communicating and finding a middle ground with the opposition.  If we think of a stream like a body of water, there are rapids and calm areas, the calm areas of our stream result in beneficial conversations whereas the rapids are chaotic, and little to no beneficial conversation is made.  I personally would say the Garden is better but the Garden does not exist at least on a large scale level. The stream however exists everywhere online. Take Twitter for example, infamous for being toxic, especially in terms of politics. Twitter is a stream with plenty of rapids, however, there also exist calm spots in which beneficial discourse is made amongst users.

### Key Take Aways:
* The Garden is better but not realistic
* The stream is worse but at least realistic
* All social media platforms are streams
