In [[@caulfieldGardenStreamTechnopastoral2015]] there are two ways in which humans can interact. They can interact via the Stream or the Garden. The Garden allows individuals to rearrange ideas and prexisting knowledge. The Garden is a way to build or rather grow off other ideas to expand the knowledge or ideas of interest. The stream allows us to prove and disprove and grow off ideas. This is benefitial and problematic. Some people enter the stream in hopes of learning something new and enlightening others, however there are also those who enter the stream in hopes to always be right rather than communicate and find middle groud with the opposition.  If we think of a stream like a body of water, there are rapids and calm areas, the calm areas of our stream result in benefitial converstions whereas the rapids are chaotic and little to no benefital converstion is made.  I personally would say the Garden is better but the Garden does not exist at least on a large scale level. The stream however exists everywhere online. Take Twitter for example, imfamous for being toxic, especially in terms of politics. Twitter is a stream with plenty of rapids, however, there also exists calm spots in which benefitial discourse is made amongst users.

### Key Take Aways:
* The Garden is better but not realistic
* The stream is worse but at least realistic
* All social media platforms are streams
