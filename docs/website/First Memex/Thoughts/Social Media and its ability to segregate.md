> This brings us to learning design. Dave Cormier had an interesting post a month or so ago about how “every we makes a them”. You get a large class together and it fragments, partially to protect itself from scale. Cliques develop. The cool kids table emerges. Others complain they are not being attended to, the cool kids say well sorry but we know each other and we want to sit next to one another.

This is where social media is particularly interesting. To understand what Im about to say, we must agree on the basic undeniable concept, that social media companies want to keep you on the app as long as possible. Thus, the algorithm tailors to you're liking in order to keep you engaged as long as possible to generate revenue. Now if we look at social media through a political lens this is especially dangerous. The algorithm promotes ideas that fit your political ideologies to keep you engaged. This is especially problematic because it plunges you into a rabbit hole in which you're emotions are controlled by a computer designed to exploit you.
