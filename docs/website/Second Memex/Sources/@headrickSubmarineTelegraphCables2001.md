> - **Abstract:** International telecommunication is not only a business but also a political enterprise, the subject of great-power rivalries. In the late nineteenth century, British firms held a near monopoly, because Britain had more advanced industry, a wealthier capital market, and a merchant marine and colonial empire that provided customers for the new service. After the 1880s, they encountered increasing competition on the North Atlantic from American, German, and French firms. Elsewhere, the British conglomerate Eastern and Associated retained its hegemony until the 1920s. Following World War I, radiotelegraphy threatened the dominance of cables. In the 1930s, cable companies were almost bankrupted by the Depression and by competition from shortwave radio.

> The first generation of cables, laid in response to the urgent needs of the two major colonial powers, failed because the technology was not yet sufficiently developed to satisfy the demands of its customers. The failure of both the cables themselves and the techniques of laying them constitutes what historian of technology Thomas Hughes has called a "reverse salient."9

> In 1838, William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, a British physician and professor of chemistry at the Calcutta Medical College, successfully laid three kilometers of insulated wire in the bed of the Hooghly River. His experiment was purely scientific, however, for there was neither the demand nor sufficient capital for such a service in India at that time.4

Many of the cables laid in seas other than the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean had more strategic than commercial value. And when war broke out, as we shall see, cables proved to be powerful weapons.2

Nonetheless, the Treasury paid the stockholders of the Red Sea Telegraph Company ?36,000 a year for the next fifty years.8
