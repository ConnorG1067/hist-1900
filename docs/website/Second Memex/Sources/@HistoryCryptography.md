> While Julius Caesar’s monoalphabetic substitution cipher is probably the most famous of the ancient world’s techniques, it is not alone. A hundred years before Julius Caesar came up with his shifted alphabet cipher, a Greek historian, Polybius, developed his own version of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher that has had enormous influence in the two thousand plus years since.

> Into this period was born Abu Yūsuf Ya-qūb ibn Isāq as-Sabbāh al-Kindi (801–873 C.E.), a polymath who was the philosopher of the age. Al-Kindi wrote books in many disciplines including astronomy, optics, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, and linguistics, but his book on secret messages for court secretaries, A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages is the most important to the history of cryptology. It is in this book that the technique of frequency analysis is first described.

> . It is also true that neither side employed professional cryptographers. As with nearly all military organizations up until the twentieth century, intelligence and cryptography were areas that were not considered important during peacetime
>
>> I can understand the military's lack of concern, however its interesting that professionals were not employed especially since information is so valuable in times of war. You'd think either side would be extremely cautious in what information is provided amongst each other

> The British were a world power in 1776 and were amply prepared for a military expedition 3000 miles from their shores. Already during the eighteenth century they had fought and won wars in North America, several European countries, Ireland, and India. While they did not have a formal military intelligence unit, most of their line army officers were acquainted with intelligence gathering and were at least passingly familiar with codes and ciphers.

> The Confederate cipher system was insecure not because of the system itself, but because of how it was used by the Confederate Army. There are three reasons why the Confederates themselves made the system less secure. First, they kept word divisions in the cryptograms. This basic enciphering mistake made it much easier for the Union cryptanalysts to guess probable words in the ciphers. It also allowed them to guess parts of the key word or phrase more easily.

>> What implications did the have on the civil war? Did they realize during the time of the war they're system was insecure? Or was it only after?
