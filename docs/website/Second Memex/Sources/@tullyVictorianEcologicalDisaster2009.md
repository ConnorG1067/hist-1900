> - **Abstract:** Until the invention of the electric telegraph, messages sent across the vast colonial empires of the nineteenth century took many months to arrive. By 1907, some 200,000 nautical miles of cable criss-crossed the ocean floors. Insulation of the cables from seawater relied on gutta-percha, a natural plastic related to rubber. Gutta-percha is all but forgotten today, but during the Victorian era it was a household word. Ironically, the high-tech Victorian telegraph industry was served by a primitive cottage industry. The gum was extracted by killing wild trees in the forests of Southeast Asia, and the scale of demand ensured that many millions of trees were destroyed. This industry brought about a Victorian ecological disaster that presaged the greater destruction of tropical rain forests occurring today.

The problem was solved by the invention of the electric telegraph, which could put the least significant British, Belgian, German, or French colonial outpost into almost instantaneous contact with Whitehall, the rue de Brederode, the Reichskolonialamt, or the Q

> eds. The key to the success of the new system was a natural plastic, gutta-percha (almost forgotten today), which proved indispensable as insulation for the submarine cables. However, as this article will show, the "gum" was obtained by profligate, inefficient, and ultimately unsustainable methods of extraction, which killed the trees in the pro

> Until the nineteenth century, messages traveled with often excruciating slowness. A fleet-footed messenger might cover ten miles in an hour, depending on the terrain and weather, and a horse might reach speeds of more than thirty miles an hour or more for short distances. In the eighteenth century, it took the best part of a whole summer's day on level, dry terrain to deliver a message one hundred miles on horseback - and that
