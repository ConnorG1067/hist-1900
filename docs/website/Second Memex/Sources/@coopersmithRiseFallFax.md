> Radio Corporation of America (RCA) saved the Boston Symphony Orchestra in December 1937 when the full score of Jean Sibelius’ “Uko, the Fire Maker” failed to arrive by mail from Finland. RCA arranged for a European Picture Telegraphy service to fax the score from Helsinki to Berlin, where RCA Communications radiophotoed it to New York for printing. A courier then sped the reconstituted sections to Boston.

> Fearing technical dependence on a rival or the reputation of a technological laggard, media groups funded competing lines of equipment and developed their own PT services.

> Before faxing could extend the realms of visual culture, however, the technology had to work. This chapter begins with the major changes in the actual technologies and then explores their attempted applications in Europe, the United States, and Japan.

> If the essence of engineering was controlling the environment, then faxing suffered from bad engineering. Facsimile faithfully recorded the imperfections of a telephone circuit that normally people mentally filtered in a conversation.

> As speeds and distances increased, so did the challenge of synchronization. Vacuum tubes enabled tuning forks to synchronize transmissions, but tuning forks demanded a closely monitored and controlled physical environment to maintain accurate calibration, often demanding hours to attain (for the Marconi-Wright system, the temperature had to vary by less than 0.05 degree Fahrenheit).22

> Fax evolved in a rapidly changing environment of actual and predicted competition. Engineers, managers, investors, and consumers judged facsimile not just by itself but in comparison with regular and air mail, telegraphic and telephonic services, the established standard (AM) radio, and the promise of FM radio and television.

> Facsimile’s most serious competition remained telegraphy, which had advantages of decades of familiarity by customers, tens of thousands of skilled telegraph engineers and operators, reliable equipment, and codes and other social structures that integrated telegraphy into office operations.

#### Definitions / concepts

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> The number of fax machines actually was quite small—less than a hundred in 19335—but their significance extended far beyond their numbers because their customers were newspapers.

> Firms developing fax also developed its competitors, wisely not placing all their bets in one technological basket.

> Long-distance telephone calls increased from 13 million in 1919 to 49 million in 1929 and 59 million in 1939, showing both the need for immediate long-distance communications and a way to meet that demand orally.25

> number of telegrams grew from 139 to 234 million before the depression years reduced that to 189 million in 1939.26

#### Questions / confusion

> [!quote|#ffd400] Highlight
> These failures were increasingly economic as well as technological, indicating the growing maturation of fax technology, albeit still not at the levels of reliability, capability, practicality, and affordability needed to successfully compete against increasingly capable rivals.
>
>> Why did the failures occur
>

> [!quote|#ffd400] Highlight
> “Facsimilists” perceived television not as a competitor but as an expensive “personalized delivery of motion pictures” that offered only “fleeting, moving images on a screen, whereas fax provides a recorded duplicate of each transmitted page.”3
>
>> Sure, at the time televisions were expensive and unaffordable for most, however now it is completely normal
