As previously mentioned in this memex, encryption has been around as long as the need for sharing information has been around, but as decryption advances so does encryption. All messages have a medium and all messages that require privacy have encryption. Thus, each medium requires a level of encryption that is directly associated with its intentions. For example from a political perspective, Julius Caesar utilized the Ceasar shift in order to share private information.  Another example to highlight Eric's quote is, Britain's attempt to set up a cable line to India during the Sepoy rebellion.
