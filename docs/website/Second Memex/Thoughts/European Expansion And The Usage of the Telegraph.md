The telegraph proved to be a vital tool for European expansion. It allowed various countries in Europe to communicate with the individuals in the corresponding colonies. For example, in 1857-1858 The Sepoy rebellion in India was causing British officers grievances on site. The British government paid extremely large sums of euros in order to build a cable system to India. However, the cable was dropped on rough surfaces which inevitably broke the cable. This cable broke before any messages could've been sent. However, the advantages of this idea of instant communication to manage the colonies allow for quick immediate responses to rebellions and preventive measures for possible rebellions.  Power is obtained through land and Britain's access to the telegraph made managing their colonies significantly easier. To conclude, it's quite apparent that communication in a military context is vital.
