Now Will defines the stream nowadays, which most of us can relate to. However, back when the internet didn't exist, what was the stream? Was the term obsolete before the internet or did the Telegraph and Fax serve as a starting point?  That is, is it possible the early methodologies of communications such as the fax and telegraph were the starting point for the stream?
