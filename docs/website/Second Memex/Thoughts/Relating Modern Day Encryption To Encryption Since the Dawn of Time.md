A hundred years before Julius Caesar came up with his shifted alphabet cipher, a Greek historian, Polybius, developed his own version of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher that has had enormous influence in the two thousand plus years since.

The need for encryption dates back extremely far and yet is still needed today. Many of our messages today are encrypted to prevent various security threats. The reason for encryption is to prevent said threats. However threats change with time, yet encryption has the same goal, hide information from those who are not supposed to see it. As technology advances so do schemes of compromising data.  In essence, as those who attempt to solve the encryption algorithms become more advanced and have more tools readily available to them, the encryptors themselves do too.
