> Radio Corporation of America (RCA) saved the Boston Symphony Orchestra in December 1937 when the full score of Jean Sibelius’ “Uko, the Fire Maker” failed to arrive by mail from Finland. RCA arranged for a European Picture Telegraphy service to fax the score from Helsinki to Berlin, where RCA Communications radiophotoed it to New York for printing. A courier then sped the reconstituted sections to Boston.

The fax machine was different. Significantly different. It allowed for instant information to be transmitted through various networks. One example is the Radio Corporation of America saving an orchestra event. The mailing never arrived with the results and thus the RCA has a fax service retrieve the score from Berlin. This example is one of plenty that demonstrates how this type of communication via the fax machine changed the world. The traditional methods of communicating information over long distances require lots of work from various parties which are prone to human error. The mail for this particular example never arrived, however the fax machine was readily availale to solve the issue. Its easy to take this type of technology for granted, however it is truely amazing that in times of desperation information can be relayed instantly.
