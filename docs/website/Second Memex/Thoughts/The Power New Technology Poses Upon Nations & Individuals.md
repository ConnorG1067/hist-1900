The Fax Machine and the Telegraphy were old methods of managing the Mediums and Messages. As learned in class, those who control the mediums and messages control the information which directly impacts power. The Fax Machine and Telegraphy are only examples of the association of power and technology, but we see it even today with social media. Those who have a large following can control the views of those who follow them. When new technology is world-changing, those of the minority who control said technology has the capabilities to control those who are dependent on said technology.
