The modern internet has a layer of censorship associated with it. A new idea of "Cancelling" sometimes justified other times not has emerged as a result of the internet.  Various people expressing their political idealogies online have been cancelled. The purpose of a cancellation is to silence the opposition and revoke their voice in order to further your own narrative. The internet Gopher Team preferred a free exchange of ideas on the internet, however, that is no longer an option as we are too far down a rabbit hole of unspoken internet rules.
