The modern internet has a layer of censorship associated with it. A new idea of "Cancelling" is sometimes justified other times not has emerged as a result of the internet.  Various people expressing their political ideologies online have been cancelled. The purpose of cancellation is to silence the opposition and revoke their voice to further their narrative. The Internet Gopher Team preferred a free exchange of ideas on the Internet, however, that is no longer an option as we are too far down a rabbit hole of unspoken Internet rules.

### Key Take Aways:
* Cancelling people with different views
* Limited freedom of speech and free flow of information
* Lack of respect online
