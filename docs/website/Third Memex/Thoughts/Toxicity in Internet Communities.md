> What this origin story leaves out are the thousands of people running highly local networks of personal computers who created early online communities at a grassroots level. Because they foreshadowed the intensely personal and interactive blogs, forums, and social media platforms that emerged later, exploring how these communities developed and sustained themselves not only provides a fuller history of the internet, but offers insights into how we might build healthier online communities that are more just, equitable, and inclusive.

The general concencus is that online communities are toxic due to the desenatization of humans in the online world. Now that social unspoken rules have been set in the online world, its likely too late to make major change, however, is it possible that these rules could've altered in the early stages of the internet in order make the internet a more inclusive, and equitable place for discussion? Twitter for example is a toxic social media platform. It has become a place to disagree on politics rather than to discuss politics. The internet should've been a utopia for people to communicate regarding any topic in a civil and logical way, yet its become quiet the opposite.
