As discussed in class, there are various ways to exchange information, these are called mediums. The internet is the main medium or exchange of information in the modern world. The internet, specifically social media platforms utilize algorithms to keep users on the said application as long as possible. In terms of a political perspective, this algorithm can pose a serious threat.
