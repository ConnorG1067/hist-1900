Typically computer are association with perfection, since they do exactly what they are told. If a computer makes a mistake, it was human error. The quote above from The Myth of the World Wide Web alludes to how computers are not infact perfect since there is an inventor behind every site, algorithm, or program. The program is a reflection of the character of the inventor. Thus the internet is a personified entity of the pioneers of the internet. 

Nowadays social media, the main medium of communication, is personified as an entity in which the charactersitics of the entity are shown through the reflection of the user base. This connects to my note [[Dangers of Algorithms and Information Exchange]] due to the fact that these networks of individuals can confirm biases and leave a closed mind on reality.
