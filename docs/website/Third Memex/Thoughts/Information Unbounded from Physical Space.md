The fall of the Berlin Wall was a major historic event which symbolized the freedom of information. East and West Germany could share information among one another without physical barriers in their way. The destruction of the Berlin Wall symbolizes the construction of the web. Tearing down the wall meant that information was free to move throughout East and West Germany. The creation of the Web meant that information was now free to move throughout the world, with very few restrictions.  ^353aed
