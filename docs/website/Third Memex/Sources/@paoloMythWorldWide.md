> Joseph Campbell’s monomyth is based on three main stages of the hero’s journey (Fig. 5): the departure or call to adventure, the initiation, and the return or reintegration within society. According to Campbell, the journey, which exalts the figure of the hero, is interpreted as a response to the social need for meaningful stories able to organize and give sense to reality.

> Notably, this myth of the Web’s origins contrasts sharply with the military narrative of the Internet’s origins, thus reinforcing the idea of a re-appropriation of the technology by research centres and academics.

> [!quote|#5fb236] Highlight
> In Campbell’s monomyth, the departure is followed by the second phase, the initiation, in which the hero transgresses the threshold to an unknown world in which the core of the adventure takes place. This stage includes the hero overcoming several trials and finally completing his quest, for which he might receive a material or immaterial reward.

> [!quote|#5fb236] Highlight
> Once the Web had spread globally, in fact, new responsibilities and trials emerged as Berners-Lee struggled to protect his invention from new powers threatening the Web’s public domain, as well as to preserve the message it conveys through the mythological narrative inscribed in its biographical path.

> As for the other stages in the hero’s path, the return phase also applies well to the construction of biographical narratives related to the Web as a medium.

#### Relevant / important

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> Hafner’s introduction suggests that the Web should ‘lay claim’ to its inventor Berners-Lee; thus Hafner treats the Web as a real and active subject able to dialogue and share positive values such as democracy and generosity with a human heroic figure. This is only one example of the extent to which the Web and its inventor have become two connected symbols embodying an imaginary that was narratively constructed during the very same years of the Web’s global spread.

> He (Conway, the father rev.) was reading books on the brain, looking for clues about how to make a computer intuitive, able to complete connections as the brain did. We discussed the point [...] The idea stayed with me that computers could become much more powerful if they could be programmed to link otherwise unconnected information. (BernersLee 2000: 4)

> [!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight
> The parallels drawn by Berners-Lee between CERN’s organizational structure (which represented a micro-model of the new society) and the need for a new system of information management, pointed out that technological and social change were following a common path, or in other words, that the same biographical transitions would occur both within the media landscape and in everyday life.

> According to Campbell, when the hero completes his quest and his initiation, he might reach an apotheosis that takes him closer to a godlike state which is, however, never to be fully reached, as the story of Prometheus teaches us (Campbell 2004: 127–147).

> the unsung – or at least undersung – hero of the information age. Even by some of the less breathless accounts, the World Wide Web could prove as important as the printing press. That would make Berners-Lee comparable to, well, Gutenberg, more or less. Yet so far, most of the wealth and fame emanating from the Web have gone to people other than him. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, drives a MercedesBenz and has graced the cover of several major magazines. Berners-Lee has graced the cover of none, and he drives a 13-year-old Volkswagen Rabbit. He has a smallish, barren office at M.I.T., where his nonprofit group, the World Wide Web Consortium, helps set technical standards for the Web, guarding its coherence against the potentially deranging forces of the market. (Wright 1997: 64)

> Crucially, the preservation of Web neutrality is ensured through a process that involves continuity and change at the same time. In this context, paradigmatic shifts in the conventions and uses of the medium are offered as biographical narratives through which the Web’s participatory and neutral ideology is preserved even in the process of change.

> It was clear that MIT was very much in control, moving faster, with more experience and relevant contacts. Some people in Europe expressed concern that Web technology would move west, leaving Europe behind. I knew I had to move to the center of gravity of the Internet, which was the United States.

> we look, for instance, at the way in which early accounts of the Web included specific figures of speech (e.g., metaphors and analogies, see Ratzan 2000), familiar and figurative concepts, and old narratives of change and well-known objects; if we understand this pattern of associations we will gain a deeper understanding of how this new medium was integrated into everyday life.

#### Definitions / concepts

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> The composite hero of the monomyth is a personage of exceptional gifts. Frequently he is honored by his society, frequently unrecognized or disdained. He and/or the world in which he finds himself suffers from a symbolical deficiency.

#### Questions / confusion

> [!quote|#ffd400] Highlight
> The sacrifice is thus an act that reinforces the characterization and the identity of the hero as much as the intrinsic value of his invention.
>
>> By releasing his invention he also releases all responsibility of said invention. Does this really make him a hero? Simply because he denies money and responsibility associated with his invention?
