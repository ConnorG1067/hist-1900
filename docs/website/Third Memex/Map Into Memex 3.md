### Welcome

This is a guide into my third memex, this guide should equip you with all the necessities of getting the most out of my memex

First Take a look at my sources, understand the gist of the source and my interpretation of what is important/unimportant and what I agree/disagree with. After you've looked at the sources pick whichever ones interest you the most. Look through the notes and determine which sources match the source of interest. Once you've found an interesting note with the source you wanted, read through it, and attempt to understand the connection of the note to the source. Now that you've read through the note, there's more to unpack. You can visit the related links section to find other notes which are directly or indirectly associated with the note you found interesting. There are several tags at the top of each note, this will help you determine which topic specifically interests you.
