### A breakdown of the journey between Mediums of Encryption & they're evolution & Political Censorship Online

Our journey begins with [[Mediums of Encryption & they're evolution]]. This initial note provides the readers with an understanding of what exactly a medium is, and their evolution. Following the description and their brief history, we move into the idea of connections and their variations of strength. This is to give the reader an understanding that all ideas have connections and it's up to us, the writer and reader, to determine what these connections are. The next note in our journey is about the cold war between the United States and Russia. This "war" demonstrates the mediums of communication. Propaganda was the main medium being fed to both countries on both sides. However, the technological advancements made during this time also played a role in how people communicated. Not too long after the cold war, the Berlin Wall fell, this was symbolic. It demonstrated the free flow of information between individuals regardless of their origin. With the expansion of information and ways to communicate said information comes, those who have malicious intent. misinformation and disinformation are at an all-time high due to the expansion of mediums. As more and more of the world population turns to technology the more influence individuals have. Influencers influence people. They have large followings and they intend to make money, not better society (typically).  Finally, we complete our journey with political censorship. As discussed there are a variety of mediums, however, those with power and influence can determine which mediums are accessible to a particular demographic. Each medium has its messages unique to itself. Thus those who control the mediums control the messages.
