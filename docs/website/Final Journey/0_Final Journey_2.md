My main aim for the course 
-   The evolution of the internet, Important individuals in its development
-   Dangers associated with the internet and various solution
-   When did it become mainstream and why
-   How would the world be today without the internet
-   Can it affect our evolution as a species

The two which I unintentionally or subconciously dove into were, "The Dangers associated with the internet and various solutions" & "The evolution of the internet, Important individuals in its development"


### "The evolution of the internet, Important individuals in its development"

## The Journey Between docs/website/Second Memex/Thoughts/Mediums of Encryption & they're evolution and docs/website/Third Memex/Thoughts/Association with Perfection & Computers
- docs/website/Second Memex/Thoughts/Mediums of Encryption & they're evolution
- ![[Mediums of Encryption & they're evolution]]
	- Encryption precedes the internet but only got more sophisticated out of the necessity of the internet. Encryption has been and will always be part of our lives as a society regardless of the internet's existance. For example, encryption played a critical role in the Cold War, as it enabled both the United States and the Soviet Union to protect their military and intelligence communications from being intercepted and deciphered by the other side. Both sides invested heavily in developing advanced encryption technologies to ensure their communications remained secure. This ties into the [[The Cold Wars Impact On Technology In The West]] note created in Memex 3.
- ![[Social Media and its ability to segregate]]
	- Unfortunately, with anything, there are downsides. For instance, the internet forms communities, which is positive. But as communities develop, segregation thrives and other communities are alienated. From a political perspective, The algorithm on various apps promotes ideas that fit your political ideologies to keep you engaged. This is especially problematic because it plunges you into a rabbit hole in which you're emotions are controlled by a computer designed to exploit you. The "Political Divide" is known on the internet as the increasing polarization of political beliefs and opinions that are amplified due to the power individuals hold on the internet.
- ![[Detecting misinformation online]]
	- Similar to [[Social Media and its ability to segregate]] those with power can spread misinformation or disinformation unintentionally or intentionally. Misinformation is often scary and emotional. Peoples respond better to misinformation simply because it gets a bigger reaction out of people. The role of misinformation in the development of the internet has been twofold. On the one hand, it has posed significant challenges to the ability of individuals to discern truth from fiction. This can have serious consequences, as misinformation can lead to harmful beliefs and actions. Again from a political perspective, people share information that may or may not be true to simply confirm biases
- ![[Toxicity in Internet Communities]]
	- As a result of misinformation and segregation toxicity online has been exponential. People feel free to express themselves without any reprocussions. This concept is important in the role of the development of the internet. Its important to understand why this occurs. It is difficult for people to feel empathy online. This causes them to disregard feelings and resort to personal attacks in order to confirm their veiw points
- ![[Dangers of Algorithms and Information Exchange]]
	- The algorithms and information exchange linkage is very problematic in terms of politics, misinformation and the general spread of knowledge. Algorithms have also preceded the internet, however, like everything, they've only become more sophisticated as time has passed. Thus as the internet has evolved algorithms' intentions and advancedness have also evolved and changed. More recently people tend to want informational power over others and thus an algorithm which tailors to specific biases and help. Toxicity, misinformation and segregation all have a significant part in algorithms.

### "The Dangers associated with the internet and various solutions"

## The Journey Between docs/website/First Memex/Thoughts/Social Media and it's capabilities to breed extremeists and docs/website/Third Memex/Thoughts/Dangers of Algorithms and Information Exchange
- docs/website/First Memex/Thoughts/Social Media and it's capabilities to breed extremeists
- ![[Social Media and it's capabilities to breed extremeists]]
	- As we've all seen and as I've learned throughout this course. The internet is a prime place for people to go down a political or ideaological rabbit hole. In order to further understand this problem I've been on a variety of sites where racism, sexism, homophobia, and anti-semitism. The individuals preyed on the vulnerable and promised brother good in exchange for abiding by their extreme idealologies.

- ![[Information Unbounded from Physical Space]]
	- Information unbounded from physical space has its benefits and its downsides. Since this specific question is interested in the issues we will explore the various problems associated with information unbounded by physical space. If information is not bounded anyone or anybody can say anything to anyone. This is good and bad. This note is specifically related to misinformation and political censorship online. If information has no bounds its extent is limitless. Now what if said information is also wrong or harmful to specific communities? We've seen this with covid-19. Uneducated people were more afraid of the Asian community rather than other racial communities because the illness originated in an Asian country. This is neither right nor logical. And this was due to misinformation online.
- ![[@southwellMisinformationMisunderstoodChallenge2019|Misinformation as a Misunderstood Challenge to Public Health]]
	- More specifically various issues are associated with public health and the internet. First, let's say most body types are actually attainable despite what the majority of society tells you. However, I do agree that there is a problem with individuals seeing others online and wanting to have the same body type. It's possible that they can have the desirable body type, however, they go about it in a bad way, such as eating disorders or steroids, etc. Another prevalent example of this was covid-19. The vaccine had/has issues, however, from a probability standpoint it is safer to take the vaccine than it is to not take it.  Based on anecdotal evidence online people were refusing to take the vaccine.

## Conclusion
In conclusion two of my big questions throughout the course were covered and in great detail. Despite being a bit uncomfortable with the layout of this course it was well worth it. I learned how to explore topics for myself, dive deeper into questions I've had, and develop a repository of information with various interlinkages. "The Dangers associated with the internet and various solutions" & "The evolution of the internet, Important individuals in its development" were both compressed into the notes above, into bite-size pieces where the user of my personal memex may further dive into, in order to develop a further understanding.
