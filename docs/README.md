### Getting Started
1. First visit the thoughts (pick one that interests you).
2. Each thought it related to a certain source given.
3. These thoughts have tags at the top, if you're interested in a particular tag you can search for it.
4. After you've read the thought you may visit the source from which said thought came from.
5. In the source you will see all my personal notes I took while reading the source. 
6. Each note is meant to stimulate ideas that eventually turn into thoughts
7. The page number is provided for each note along with the source to find exactly where my note is coming from.

#### Tips
1. Utilize the tags - Tags are perfect if you're interested in a particular topic and want more information about said topic
2. Search through my notes and easily find where these notes were extracted in the original text to get a deeper understanding. The notes are meant to help create thoughts, they're not summaries, if you want more information or context you must look through the original source.
3. Each thought/source has various tags associated with this, this is best understood visually in [[Interlinkages]]. Here, in interlinkages, you can see all the connections of my ideas and sources in a nice visual format. These Interlinkages help you, the reader, understand the thought process as well as the connections between thoughts which stem from sources.
