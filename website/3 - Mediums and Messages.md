The medium is the message

The Medium is something that carries something else.
Lets think about that relationship, that carrying.

The person who classifies or invents the forms of mediums has power
They control how knowledge is dispersed 
The controller can put bounds on these things via the mediums

"Classifications both reflect and direct our thinking. THe way we order represent the way we think" --> Stephen Jay Gould

The control of mediums is not a new thing, its been around for a while and thus the control of information is old as well. An archieve is strictly for work/reaserch. The library if related to pleasure or something like that

PLOT
* The medium for a message is as important as is the message
* How we classify media/messages has implications for power, control, and discipline.
* Writing/counting intimately connected
* The infrastructure for writing spills out, has impacts on society
* Libraries reflect the world back to itself
* There is no natural way to organize materials in a library

Korean moveable type 1377 used for the Jikji (Some book about boodest teachings)

Melvil Dewey
* His library is ass
* No systematic organization of the world
* Develops a method of organizing the worlds knowledge
* The top of his organizations structure is Phil, Theology, government, Philology, Nature, Fine arts, geo, biography, history

>"The study of invisible writings was a new discipline made available by the discovery of the bi-directional nature of Library-Space. The thaumic mathematics are complex, but boil down to the fact that all books, everywhere, affect all other books. This is obvious: books inspire other books written in the future, and cite books written in the past" - Pratchett

>"associative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail" - V Bush

New Plot:
* No natural way for documents/information to be organized;
* People tried to find a natural way to organize information
	* These categorizations ended up reifying the way they already believed the world to work.

Conclusion
1. The physicality of messages/books has impacts in the world
2. This physicality has changed over time/thus impacts the world have changed
3. When new classifications shift, theres a shift in power
